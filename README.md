Optimizing Decaf Complier
=========================

An optimizing Decaf-to-x86 compiler for 6.035.


Current State of Compiler
-------------------------

Currently, only the scanner and parser are implemented.  The parser
creates a parse tree.  The parse tree is not yet processed into an
Abstract Syntax Tree.


Testing
-------

The code currently passes all scanner and parser tests that the course
staff have made public.

Additional tests are forthcoming.
